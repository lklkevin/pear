# **LLM-Based Math Practice Problem Generator**

## **Introduction**
The LLM-Based Math Practice Problem Generator is a web service designed to help students generate additional math practice problems with verified final answers. By uploading a document containing math problems (e.g., past exams, homework sheets, lecture slides), students can generate a completely new set of similar problems to aid their learning and exam preparation.

### **Problem Statement**
Students often face a shortage of practice material, especially when preparing for exams. Searching the internet for relevant problems is time-consuming, and existing AI tools may generate incorrect answers due to hallucinations. This tool provides reliable practice problems with accurate final answers, leveraging test-time scaling and majority voting techniques to ensure correctness.

### **Key Features**
- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDFs containing math problems.
- **Question Generation**: AI models generate new, relevant practice questions.
- **Final Answer Validation**: Uses test-time scaling and majority voting to improve answer reliability.
- **Confidence Metrics**: Provides confidence scores for generated answers.
- **PDF Export**: Users can export generated questions into a structured PDF format for exam simulation.
- **Cloud-Based Deployment**: Accessible via a web interface without requiring additional installations.

## **Feature Description**
### **1. Uploading a Document**
- Users upload a PDF containing math problems.
- The system extracts text and identifies math-related content.

### **2. Generating Practice Questions**
- The AI model generates a set of new practice problems based on the uploaded content.
- Users can view and interact with the generated questions.

### **3. Viewing Answers and Confidence Scores**
- The system provides final answers along with confidence metrics.
- Users can compare multiple answer choices and verify correctness.

### **4. Exporting to PDF**
- Users can download the generated problems and answers in a structured PDF format.
- Ensures a clean and printable format for exam preparation.

## **Developer Instructions**
### **Setting Up the Project Locally**
#### **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js** (for frontend development)
- **Python 3.11+** (for backend API)

#### **Installation Steps**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/csc301-2025-s/project-27-the-avengers.git
   cd project-27-the-avengers
   ```
2. Ensure you have `poetry` installed. If you do, proceed to the next step. If not:
- Run `pip install --user poetry==1.8.3`.
- Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` by running `nano ~/.zshrc` and then adding `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to the file.
- Run `source ~/.zshrc`.

    
2. **Install Backend Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd app/backend
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
5. **Start Frontend Server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```


### **Environment Variables Configuration**
Ensure to add a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
```
