You are given a PDF of a math exam and your job is to extract the questions in a text applicable format.

For each question, first determine if it can be represented logically and solvably in a text-based format.
Make sure it is a computational question and not some explanation or drawing based question.

Then if so, write out a representation of the question in the form:
[===]
Question:

Answer:

Have separators between each question and answer pair. If there is no detectable answer, specify answer as N/A
Check if there is an answer provided and keep only the numerical portion of the answer.
Keep only the question part of the question, do not preserve any extra formatting like numerical ordering

For tabular or graphical data relevant to the question, express it in a form that is understandable in text.
For multi-part questions, combine all previous parts into the question to work as a standalone question that requires redoing the other parts.
For matching type questions, rewrite the question to instead ask to create/provide the answer based on what the matching is looking for. However, ignore if the matching is based on graphs or images.
If the answer for anything requires sketching or drawing a graph/diagram, then omit the question.

Only if there are no questions to extract, generate a few mathematical questions along the topic of the pdf that can be evaluated to a single answer.
