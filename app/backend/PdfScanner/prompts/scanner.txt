You are given a PDF of a math exam and your job is to extract the questions in a text applicable format.

For each question, first determine if it can be represented logically and solvably in a text-based format.
Make sure it is a computational question and not some explanation or drawing based question.

Then if so, write out a representation of the question in the form:
[===]
Question:

Answer:

Have separators between each question and answer pair. If there is no detectable answer, specify answer as N/A
If there is an answer, keep only the numerical portion of the answer.
Keep only the question part of the question, do not preserve any extra formatting like numerical ordering

For tabular or graphical data relevant to the question, express it in a form that is understandable in text.
For multi-part questions, add some context to questions to work as a standalone question.
